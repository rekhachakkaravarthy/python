All varaibles declared in python will be stored in a reserved memory location.
python has different data types. some of the main ones are numbers , tuples , strings , dictionary and Lists.
To declare a variable as global we need to use the keyboard "GLOBAL" to the variable . 
without global keyword declaration the variable will be only in local scope.
To delete the varaible we need to use the keyword "DEL"
